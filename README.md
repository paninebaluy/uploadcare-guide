# A task for an Uploadcare writer

Hi! 

This is a task by Natalie from Uploadcare.

We need to make sure we can work together on creating meaningful and helpful content.

Here is our product documentation: [https://uploadcare.com/docs/](https://uploadcare.com/docs/)

Our potential clients have trouble understanding how to fit an image containing a product into various divs in their app layout. Their designer works 10h/week and can’t produce multiple image versions, but Uploadcare can help them!

They’ve got an online store with the following div sizes:

1. 1800px * 500px (a product page header)

2. 300px * 600px (a product image that is located near a “Buy” button)

3. 150px * 150px (a product preview icon)

**You need to**:

* Write a short guide containing 1 or more ways to solve this issue – say, up to 400 words
* Include pictures and code samples
* Try to be as concise as possible: the potential user has to little time to browse the documentation

**Target reader of this guide**: a web developer, or a back-end developer who is forced to dabble with the front-end part of their app. 

**Assets**:

* You can use [this image](https://unsplash.com/photos/XWdRIu-Rk_0) from Unsplash, or choose another one to your liking.

**How to submit**: Please send a PR with your guide and your contacts (LinkedIn, email, Telegram)
